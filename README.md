# Last Prop Standing

> Last Prop Standing is a twist on the popular game mode Prop Hunt. The main difference is that when there's only one prop left alive said prop will become very visible, loud and will get a gun. The hunters will have 60 seconds to catch the prop. The prop can choose to run and wait out the timer or hunt the hunters. This game mode was based off of the original Prop Hunt and Fretta code, but is now built from the ground up with a lot of improvements over the original code.
